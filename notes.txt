4 base kinds of towers:
    - Sentry: Aims, then shoots
        - Status effect inflicting towers
        - Rapid fire tower
        - 
    - Spray: Just shoots
        - Homing shots
        - Ring emission

    - Spawners: Spawn friendly minions
        - Shooting minions
        - "Swarm" minions
            - Necromancer tower that resurrects nearby killed enemies
        - Melee minions

    - Aura: Base tower does nothing
        - Mine tower
            - Tower like the spike factory from btd6
        - Farm tower, generates gold
        - Buffs towers in range
            - Debuffs enemies while still buffing friendly towers  

How to handle tower upgrades if pretty much all tower variations could just be item effects? If towers will inherit player item effects then the
tower upgrades need to be more focused on changing the way that they attack instead of adding additional effects. Or I more clearly define what
items will do, i.e, no bullet modification items.
