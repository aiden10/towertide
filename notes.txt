Random events between stages?

How to balance randomness with the large amount of player expression? Right now players could always go with the same build/towers each game.
- Bosses which heavily counter certain builds
- Starting tower limits much lower and randomly incrementing one of them after each wave. Or giving the player a choice between two random tower limits
